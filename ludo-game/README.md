## Approach: 
To Create this game I first created the CSS & HTML to Design the layout of the board. I used display grid to create the board for the game. Once I had a rough sketch of how the board is I started to design my JavaScript solution. I thought about the functions and steps I would need. Once I had my design solution I started to code and test each function as I wrote them.
